### About

I recieved a BS in Cell and Molecular Biology from [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), Iran, and a MS in Nanobiotechnology from the same university in 2017. My thesis project was focused on nanotoxicity of gold nano particles and how these widely used particles can affect stucture and function of key enzymes of human nervous systme. My research included both lab work and using Molecular Dynamic simulation techniques for modeling protein structure. During my lab work I performed a lot of statistical analysis to analyze my results and that was when I decided to pursue a career in Biostatistics and integrate my knowledge in biological science with statistical and computational skills. You can learn more about me [here](about.html).
