**Welcome and thanks for visiting my website!**


I am a first year MS student in Biostatistics with focus on Theory and Methods at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I recieved a BS in Cell and Molecular Biology and MS in Nabobiotechnology from [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en), in Tehran, Iran. I am ineterested in data analysis and handling, particularly statistical analysis including descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and confirmatory data analysis (CDA) and statistical models. My ultimate goal is to have a role in improving lives through finding innovative solutions to solve problems in the public health sphere either by testing and developing new methods or evaluating and modifying available services.
